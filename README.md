# Kotlin-Koans

This repo is not official [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html)
but since we found such concept cool.
We decide to give it a go and prepare some Koans on our own.

All feedback is welcome - just open an issue.

### Currently available Koans
Currently only available Koans are for Kotlin Coroutines.
Maybe more will came with time.
