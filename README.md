# Kotlin-Koans

This repo is not official [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html)
but since we found such concept cool.
We decide to give it a go and prepare some Koans on our own.

All feedback is welcome - just open an issue.

### Currently available Koans
Currently only available Koans are for Kotlin Coroutines.
Maybe more will came with time.

### Kotlin Coroutines

- cancellation & timeout // 1a & 1b
- dispatchers - done, more or less // 2
- exceptions in suspend function - done, more or less // 3a
- exceptions while using async builder - done, more or less // 3b
- global coroutine exceptions handler - done, more or less // 3c
- starting options - done, more or less // 4
- flow // 5
- channel // 6
